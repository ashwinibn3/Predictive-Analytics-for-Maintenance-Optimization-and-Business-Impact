##  Predictive Analytics for Maintenance Optimization and Business Impact
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict equipment failures and simulate the business impact of deploying such models, using a real-world-like dataset.

Built as Dissertation Project of my MSc in Big Data & Business Intelligence (University of Greenwich).

##  Project Goals
- Predict machine failures using ML models (Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- Use confusion matrix to evaluate predictions
- Simulate cost savings from prevented failures
- Visualize results with interactive charts and trend analysis

##  Key Outcomes
- **Model Accuracy**: 81% (Gradient Boosting)
- **Failures Prevented**: 15 (vs 30 with manual approach)
- **Estimated Savings**: £30,000 in downtime cost
- **Efficiency Gain**: 50% improvement in resource allocation
- **Trend**: Monthly cost of failures reduced significantly

##  Tools & Tech
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Result
The predictive maintenance model achieved a balance between accuracy and business impact, preventing 15 equipment failures and projecting £30,000 in cost savings. This project demonstrates how machine learning can drive real-world operational improvements in resource planning and maintenance forecasting.
